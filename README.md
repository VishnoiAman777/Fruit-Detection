# Fruit-Detection
The dataset can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)
In this project I will be using image detection techniques that includes
1. Learning With Prototype
2. K nearest neighbours
3. Neural Networks
The model is trained on about 131 classes of fruits and vegetables and used for preicting the class of an image
To extract the features of an image I have used Open Cv Library and Hog Technique.
The acuuracy of each technique is appended below it
